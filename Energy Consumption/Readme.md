# Brief
This project focuses on analyzing social media data to provide actionable insights for businesses, influencers, and marketers. By leveraging interactive dashboards, the project helps optimize social media strategies, drive audience engagement, and enable data-driven decision-making. This initiative was developed as part of the DEPI Data Engineering Track, ranking in the top 20 participating teams.



# Project_Goals
- Extract insights from social media data across multiple platforms
- Provide key metrics and trends in an interactive Power BI dashboard
- Empower data-driven strategies for audience targeting and engagement



# DataSet
- The dataset used in this project is the [Social Media Sentiments Analysis Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kashishparmar02/social-media-sentiments-analysis-dataset/data)  from Kaggle
  


# How_It_Works
1. **Data Loading and Preparation**:  
   The script starts by loading multiple
   `PostDimension.csv`, `UserDimension.csv`, and `SentimentFact.csv`, using Pandas. The data is cleaned, merged, and saved into a unified dataset (`sentiment_factDEPI.csv`) for streamlined analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   Key insights are derived through EDA:
   - Checking for missing values to ensure data quality.
   - Identifying unique platforms and sentiment categories.
   - Analyzing the distribution of platforms and their associated sentiments.

3. **Data Visualization**:  
   The script generates insightful visualizations to uncover trends:
   - **Sentiment Distribution by Platform**: A bar chart shows the breakdown of sentiment categories across platforms.
   - **Follower Count vs. Sentiment Score**: A scatter plot highlights the relationship between followers and sentiment scores.
   - **Sentiment by Location**: A bar chart reveals sentiment distributions across locations.
   - **Time-Based Sentiment Trends**: A line plot illustrates daily changes in average sentiment scores.

4. **Output**:  
     Creating an interactive dashbord that provide us a comprehensive insights about businesses & influncers across several platforms such as **Facebook** , **Snapchat** , **Twitter** , **Instagram** , **Tik Tok**  to enable them to make a **data-driven decisions**
